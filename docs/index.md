# Fast Matrix Factorization for Recommendation Systems

Team Members: Zhewei Shi (zheweis), Weijie Chen (weijiec)

Project Webpage: https://zheweishi.github.io/15618-Project/

## Summary
We are going to implement two parallelized algorithms for matrix factorization in recommendation systems. The implementation and analysis will be based on both Xeon CPUs and Xeon Phi platforms.
